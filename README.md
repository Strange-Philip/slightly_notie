#### Framework
Slightly Notie is built with the **Flutter SDK** in the **Dart** programming language. This allows Slightly Notie to be deployed on multiple platforms with the same codebase and minimal platform setup.

#### Backend
The app is powered by firebase , from authentication to data storage.

#### Illustrations

Most of the illustrations are from a website i discovered (https://www.thedoodlelibrary.com/) .

#### UI/UX

Took some inspiration from pinterest but basically built out the ui all by myself ðŸ˜Œ .

##### P.S.
Feel free to clone and mess around. Pull requests are welcome. There's a lot of data from the backend that isn't being used as per the requirements of the challenge but they can make the app's UI richer.
